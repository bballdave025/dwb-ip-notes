Intellectual Property hygiene.

## What is this repository?

This repository collects intellectual-property notes, project sketches, and vision captures for a set of research ideas developed independently by the author across several years. These notes exist to establish precedence, clarify intent, and enable open collaboration without prematurely locking ideas into proprietary or confidential frameworks.

The contents are intentionally concise, dated, and public.


## Why does this exist now?

Because ideas age even when people are busy.

These notes capture work that was developed before, alongside, and independent of employment and formal programs. Publishing them now protects:

- the author’s ability to continue open research, 

- collaborators’ ability to engage safely, and

- employers’ ability to avoid IP ambiguity.

This is a boundary-setting document, not a claim of novelty absolutism.


## What this is _not_

Not a patent filing

Not a demand for exclusivity

Not a claim that no one else has ever had similar ideas

Someone has likely explored parts of these ideas before.

If you have, please tell me — I will happily cite you immediately.


## How this protects everyone involved

By making intent explicit and public:

- The author avoids accidental appropriation or later disputes.
- Employers avoid entanglement with pre-existing ideas.
- Institutions (archives, libraries, research centers) are protected from misuse, misattribution, or implied claims over their holdings.
- Collaborators can engage without legal ambiguity.

This repository documents ideas and methods, not ownership of cultural artifacts.


## Institutional respect & scope

The work referenced here engages with materials from institutions such as:

- FamilySearch
- Bibliothèque nationale de France (BnF)
- Library of Congress

and comparable national, municipal, and university libraries and archives worldwide.

No claim is made over the underlying documents, images, or collections.

Only analytical methods, annotations, and research directions are described.

## How to read this repo

Each subproject contains:

- a short IP note (`IP_Notes_-_<project>_<date>.md`)
minimal background
- explicit boundaries between open research and future work

Think of this as a map of intellectual terrain, not a finished building.
